TODO: Design the script to function as follows:
    1. Check if the website's local repo exists, if not thrown an error and exit.
    2. If the repo exists then create a template file in the appropriate directory
       (usually the "_blog" directory).
    3. With the template file created, write these contents shared below inside a pair
       "---".

TODO: Create a template with these content:
    1. "title"
    2. "description"
    3. "summary" (for SEO reasons)
    4. "slug" (to create a custom URL for the blog post and one which should also be
       used to define the filename)
    5. "publishDate" to show the date of publishing the blog post
    6. "image" (to add an image for SEO reasons)
       a. "imageUrl"
       b. "imageAltTxt"
