# Security Policy

**For any security concerns please refer to this.**

This repository hosts the Shell scripts I use to handle creation/manipulation of
the dotfiles on my personal development machines. When executed they download
certain applications from the Internet & perform certain file manipulations.
Hence use the scripts from this repository with discretion. The owner of this
repository will not be held responsible for any damage and/or unintended actions
to your personal development machine.

But, if you're willing to use the scripts from this repository & find a bug or
two, please report it to the owner immediately. You can drop an email or leave
him a tweet at--[@Jarmosan](https:twitter.com/jarmosan).

You can also open a PR if you think there's an urgent security concern. Please
refer to the [Contributing Guidelines](./CONTRIBUTING.md) on how to contribute
to the project.

**_WARNING_**: Use the contents of this repository with care. They can change
and/or manipulate stuff in your filesystem. **So know what you're doing before
cloning this repository & using the scripts in it!**
