This repository contains various "_dotfiles_" & other configuration files for my personal development needs. Following are a list of software I use regularly for all of my dev needs;

- Git
- Neovim
- VSCode
- Bat (a drop-in replacement for `cat`)
- Glow (a Markdown previewer for the TUI)
- Starship (a fast & customizable prompt)

Do note, the list of configuration is never-ending & is subject to change over time. It's **recommended** to not use the config files as is but take inspiration from & configure your own workflow.

For those of you who work from on Windows machine through some Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) instance, you should checkout my [dotfiles-windows](https://github.com/Jarmos-san/dotfiles-windows) repository. That repository contains more information on how to setup a Linux development environment on Windows 10 (and Windows 11 when it's available publicly).
